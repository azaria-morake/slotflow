## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Overview

### Main Screens

| Screen            | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Landing Page      | App intro with CTA buttons for login or register    |
| Auth Screens      | Separate forms for Admin and Learner sign-up/login  |
| Admin Dashboard   | View/create/edit courses, view bookings             |
| Learner Dashboard | View/book/cancel courses, upload profile image      |
| Notifications     | All actions are toastified and show visual feedback |

### Integration Strategy

* **JWT Handling**: Access token stored in `localStorage`
* **Axios Interceptors** auto-attach tokens to every API call
* **Bootstrap UI** for layout and forms
* **Yup** validation in all forms (register, login, course create, etc.)
* **React Hook Form** for smooth form handling and submission

## Example CLI Test (Register Admin)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin1", "email": "admin@slotflow.com", "password": "Admin@1234", "password2": "Admin@1234", "role": "admin"}'
```


---

## Workflow Summary

1. **User registers** with role (`admin` or `learner`)
2. Logs in and gets **access + refresh tokens**
3. **Admin** creates courses (optionally uploading a cover image)
4. **Learner** browses courses and makes a booking
5. Learner can **cancel**, and both actions trigger email simulation
6. Admin and learner can **upload profile pictures**

## File Structure (Simplified)

### Backend

```
slotflow-backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/              # Core Django app
â”œâ”€â”€ media/            # Uploaded images
â”œâ”€â”€ test_api.sh       # curl test script
â”œâ”€â”€ manage.py
```

### Frontend

```
slotflow-frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/        # Register, Login, Dashboards
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Header, Footer, Cards
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth/         # Context, token management
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
```

## Auth Token Flow

* **Access Token** expires in minutes
* **Refresh Token** can renew access
* Stored in localStorage for simplicity
* Interceptors ensure seamless requests
